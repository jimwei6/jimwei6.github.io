This is a project for Advanced Data Science at The University of Waseda during my exchange.
The project compares machine learning models using SIFT features with models using only pixel values on the task of face
mask classification.
<br /><br />
SIFT Models:
<ul>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>Multi-Layer Perceptron</li>
</ul>

Pixel Models:
<ul>
  <li>Flattened Multi-Layer Perceptron</li>
  <li>Convolutional Neural Network (LENET)</li>
</ul>
