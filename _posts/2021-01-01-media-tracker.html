This is a personal project extended from a class project (CPSC210 at The University of British Columbia).
Having created an desktop application that allow users to create and manage lists, I decided to apply the idea on to
managing
things related to modern entertainment such as to watch lists, watched lists, and more. I built this demo application in
Android Studio
with basic knowledge of Java and XML. The application uses free APIs on RapidAPI to fetch entertainment media data.
Users are able to create/delete lists, add/delete media into these lists, and also give reviews and ratings to each
media.
