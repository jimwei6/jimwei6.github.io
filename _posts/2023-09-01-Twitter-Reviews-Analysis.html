This is a <a href="https://github.com/jimwei6/AI-ML/blob/main/Twitter_Topic_Modeling.pdf" target="_blank">final
  paper</a> for Social Media and Data Analysis at The University of Waseda during my exchange.
The project uses LDA and BERTopic to perform topic modeling on X (Twitter)'s reviews on the Google Play Store.
The objective of this project was to see if world controversies, company scandals, and major company events could be
identified just from social media app reviews. In the end, traces of these external topics such as Twitter's acquisition
by Elon Musk, Palestine Israel conflict, and child pornography controversy were found.
