This is a group project for the "Field Area Segmentation" competition on Solafune.
The goal is to predict polygon coordinates in images in order to segment fields.
<br /></br>
<h5>Approaches:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Using Mask R-CNN to predict field locations and polygons</li>
  <li>Using Unet to predict field boundaries</li>
</ul>

<h5>Conclusion:</h5>
The best model was using Mask R-CNN to predict field locations.
However, the Mask R-CNN had trouble predicting images with large number of tiny fields, often only
predicting up to half of the fields in the image.

Comparatively, the Unet model was able to predict the field boundaries well, but the false positives
in the images resulted in thresholding, and in turn extracting polygons.
<br /><br />
<h5>Possible Improvements:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Using separate models for large fields and smalelr fields</li>
  <li>Convert Unet to multi-class (boundary, field, neither) rather than binary</li>
</ul>
