This is a class project for CPSC304 (Introduction to Relational Databases) at The University of British Columbia.
The project is a web application for vehicle drivers and parking lot managers.
<br /><br />
For vehicle drivers, they are able to search for available parking spaces in parking lots based
on their needs (duration, accessibility, and vehicle sizes).

For parking lot managers, the application automatically regulates parking by detecting vehicles that parked for longer
than the limit and issues parking tickets to those vehicles.
In addition, the application also allow parking lot managers to view visitor statistics of the parking lots they own.
