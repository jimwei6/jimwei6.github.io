  This is a class project for CPSC310 (Introduction to Software Engineering) at The University of British Columbia.
  The project is composed of three parts:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>parsing specifically structured HTML and JSON files into query-able data structures</li>
  <li>handling requests and filtering data based on provided queries to get the requested data</li>
  <li>displaying response data in the frontend</li>
</ul>
