This is a personal project extended from the bsaic desktop application of Media Tracker.
Having created an desktop application that allow users to create and manage lists, I decided to apply the idea on to
managing things related to modern entertainment such as to watch lists, watched lists, and more. I built this demo
application in Android Studio with Java and XML. The application uses free APIs on RapidAPI to fetch entertainment media
data. Functionality includes the ability to create/delete lists, add/delete media into these lists, and also give
reviews and ratings to each media.
