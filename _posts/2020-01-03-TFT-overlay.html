This is a personal project made for League of Legends Teamfight Tactics (TFT) game mode.
For quick background information, TFT is a chess like game where every piece would have special attributes and classes.
By choosing certain combination of champions, your team is able to become stronger.
The game also had items that could be combined to forge stronger items.
During the early release of TFT, viewing these information was extremely difficult. You either had to memorize them or
have it open in a separate window.
This project prevented the need of a separate window by displaying a transparent overlay with hoverable elements toview
champion and item information.
